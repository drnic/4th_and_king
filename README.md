# 4th and King

When you start bringing up a new system, during its general operation and during outages of various components, you want to know what's going on. Are the individual components ok? Are the components all communicating with each other?

The faster you know what pieces are not working as expected, the faster you can diagnose the root cause and bring them back to life.

> Why "4th and King"? 

It is the name of the first Caltrain station, leaving San Francisco southbound through Silicon Valley, on to San Jose and then Gilroy.

> I mean, why call the project "4th and King"? 

It's a metaphor.

> Of what?

Of starting a journey the same way you intend to finish it.

> That's quite a stretch.

Ok, fine. I was siting on the Caltrain, at 4th and King station waiting to go home when created the project. Happy?

> This project better be good.
